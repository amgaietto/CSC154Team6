As a user
I want to be able to my calories lost previously
So that I can compare entries on a weekly basis to make predictions or to track my progress.

Given I am a registered AND logged in user on the app
When I select "Data" AND choose to compare entries
Then I can see my calories lost in a chart with values showing changes in said values from week to week.
